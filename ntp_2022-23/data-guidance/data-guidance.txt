3. Delivery of tutoring in Independent Special Schools and centrally arranged for Looked After Children is not measured in the school census and is therefore not included here.

Variable names and descriptions for this file are provided below:

Variable name         |  Variable description
--------------------  |  ---------------------
characteristic        |  Characteristic

Footnotes:

1. Figures may not always sum to totals exactly, due to rounding. 
2. Estimates of pupil characteristics are calculated using the Spring 2022 school census. This is because some characteristics are only updated once a year at the Spring school census. The tutoring data from the Autumn 2022 school census is matched onto the Spring 2022 school census to produce pupil characteristics.  The next publication in July 2023 will be using data on pupil characteristics from the spring 2023 census.
